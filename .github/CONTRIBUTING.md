# Contributing Guide for Alotame

## Pull Requests

Any PR for the betterment of Alotame and securement of your family network is welcome!

- Branch to PR:
  - `main`
- No massive changes in a single PR
  - One change/feature per PR is preferred rather than all-in-one
  - I am single threaded, so smaller PRs are easier to review and merge ;-)
- Requirements to merge:
  - Passing CI checks
  - At least one approving review or approval from maintainer
  - No unresolved comments (TODOs, FIXMEs, etc.)

## Code Style

- Must pass `golangci-lint` checks
- Follow existing code conventions
- Comments should be in English but clear and concise for non-native speakers

## Reporting Issues

  - Providing an example code to reproduce is highly appreciated! That helps a lot!
