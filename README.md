# Alotame

<img src="alotame.png" width=25% align=left>

A local web app for **allowlist-first** [Blocky](https://github.com/0xERR0R/blocky) DNS management.

> **Blocky blocks. Alotame decides what to allow.**

## Intended audience

- Engineers running Blocky at home or local machines
- Families who want a safer default for web access
- Anyone tired of maintaining massive blocklists like [us](https://github.com/KEINOS/BlockList)

If you have ever thought *“allowlist is safer, but painful”*, this app is for you.

## Overview

- A companion app for Blocky to manage allowlist under your control
- Admin web UI to:
  - Inspect blocked domains from Blocky logs
  - Simple allowlist management (view, add, remove)
  - TOTP-based authentication to sign in securely

Blocky remains the DNS enforcement layer. Alotame only manages the allowlist.

## Use Case

Blocklists are a never-ending chase.
Allowlists are proactive and safer—but hard to live with in practice.

An allowlist-first approach flips this model: Block everything by default, and only allow what you trust.

It creates a safer and more predictable model for controlling network access.

The remaining problem is usability.
Running Blocky in allowlist-first mode is secure by design, but painful to operate in practice.

Alotame shows what was blocked and lets you decide what should be allowed—with intention.

## What This Is NOT

- Not a DNS server (use Blocky)
- Not a cloud service (runs locally)
- Not a parental surveillance tool

## About the name “Alotame”

Alotame is a piece of wordplay combining the Japanese word 「改め」(aratame) with the English words “allow” and “tame”.

「改め」(aratame) means “to revise” or “to make things right,” and loosely evokes the idea of a 「関所」(sekisho)—a checkpoint that decides what may pass.
Together with “allow” and “tame,” the name suggests gently controlling what gets through.

It’s not meant to be deep—just a playful name that fits a tool which carefully decides what to allow.
